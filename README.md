Use the VPH-Share ticket strategy as a middleware in your application:

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Strategies::Vphticket,
  host: 'https://portal.vph-share.eu',
  roles_map: {cloudadmin: 'admin', developer: 'developer'}
  ssl_verify: true #or false if self signed cert is used
```

VPH-Share Ticket is required to use this strategy. It can be retrieved after successful log in into Master Interface, located in `host` URL.

VPH-Share security mechanism is role based. `roles_map` allows to map VPH-Share
roles into application specific roles.

`ssl_verify` true/false flag is used to turn on or off ssl validation by Faraday client, while trigering ticket validation request.

The result of invoking this strategy is a object with following elements:

```
login
email
full_name
roles
```

inside `roles` array application specific roles are returned based on `roles_map` hash.

    gem 'omniauth-vph'
